Invaders: Corruption 1.2.8  -  © 2010-2013 Manuel van Dyck
==========================================================


Basic Information:
------------------
Shoot and defend yourself against the never-ending wave of invaders that clash against your ship. Collect power-ups, fly dangerously to fill the frenzy bar and use bombs whenever you are in a tight spot to ensure your continued survival. Can you stand against the dreaded chaser invaders?

Submit your scores online and see if you can rank amongst the TOP 100 of Invaders: Corruption players. Share your "core seeds" online as well and see what seeds the other players used and try the for yourself.


Default Keyboard Controls:
--------------------------
W 	-   Go Up
S 	-   Go Down
A	-   Strafe Left
D 	-   Strafe Right


Mouse Controls:
---------------
Mouse1        - Fire Weapon
Mouse2 	      - Fire Bomb

Keyboard Only and Joystick/Joypad controls are supported as well.
All keys and input methods can be reconfigured in the options menu!


General Keys:
-------------
F11 	- Toggle Sound Muting On / Off
F10 	- Toggle Fullscreen / Windowed Display
F8 	- Take Screenshot
P	- Pause Game
S	- Submit Score Online (In-Game, When prompted)
ESC 	- Quit Game / Go back to Main Menu
ALT	- Force resolution (When switching resolutions in the menu)
ALT+F4  - Immediately quit the game


Advanced Tweaks:
------------------
You can hold down either 'ALT' / 'Option' key to force setting a resolution in the menu. Beware that this can work well but it doesn't have to. Several people have no problems at all forcing resolutions whereas some others have reported crashes. Use at your own risk.

Furthermore you can edit the 'settings.ini' file for additional options and tweaks - i.e. set the resolution to anything you like, enable resolution forcing by default - etc. For best results try to stick with resolutions that match the aspect ratio of your monitor, either 4:3 (such as 1024x768) or 16:9, (such as 1280x720) toggle the game's widescreen setting accordingly. To Edit the .ini file on a Mac, right click Invaders Corruption and chose "Show Package Contents".


Online Scoring:
---------------
To view and submit online scores, you need to be connected to the internet while the game is running. Connecting after the game is running is fine. Upon pressing the 'Rank Score' menu option, your best local score will be submitted to the online score-server. If you land a Top local score you also get the option to submit the score in-game, when prompted, with the key 'S'.

Remember: The seed used to gain the Hi-Score will be shared as well and will be visible to everyone.


Further Help:
-------------
If you find any bugs or gameplay errors, or just have ideas and feature requests - and so forth - please do not hesitate to get in touch. I take my time, but I reply to all the mail that I get.


Reporting Bugs:
---------------
If you find any omissions or erroneous behavior that you deem worth reporting, please do so. I appreciate your contribution which, in turn, will help me to improve this game.
But please, take your time to provide some basic information about the error/omission, this helps me to track down the bug faster and in the end everyone wins.

I'd like to know things as:
-The version of the game the bug occurred
-When did it occur?
-Can you reproduce the error several times with the same results?
-What kind of computer do you use (PC? Mac?)
