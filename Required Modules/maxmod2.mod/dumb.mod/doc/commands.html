In no event shall the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the<br>
use of this software.<p>
Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,<br>

freely, subject to the following restrictions:<p>
1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim<br>
that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a<br>
product, you are requested to acknowledge its use in the product<br>
documentation, along with details on where to get an unmodified version of<br>
this software, but this is not a strict requirement.<p>
[Note that the above point asks for a link to DUMB, not just a mention.<br>
Googling for DUMB doesn't help much! The URL is "http://dumb.sf.net/".]<p>
[The link was originally strictly required. This was changed for two<br>
reasons. Firstly, if many projects request an acknowledgement, the list of<br>
acknowledgements can become quite unmanageable. Secondly, DUMB was placing<br>
a restriction on the code using it, preventing people from using the GNU<br>
General Public Licence which disallows any such restrictions. See<br>
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html for more information on this<br>
subject. However, if DUMB plays a significant part in your project, we do<br>
urge you to acknowledge its use.]<p>
2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be<br>
misrepresented as being the original software.<p>
3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source distribution.<p>
4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom on any Monday at<br>
3:05 pm, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten minutes. [This<br>
clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should contain at least one<br>
clause, the reasoning behind which is far from obvious.]<p>
5. Users who wish to use DUMB for the specific purpose of playing music are<br>
required to feed their dog on every full moon (if deemed appropriate).<br>
[This clause provided by Allefant, who couldn't remember what Inphernic's<br>
clause was.]<p>
6. No clause in this licence shall prevent this software from being depended<br>
upon by a product licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. If such a<br>
clause is deemed to exist, Debian, then it shall be respected in spirit as<br>
far as possible and all other clauses shall continue to apply in full<br>
force.<p>
We regret that we cannot provide any warranty, not even the implied warranty<br>
of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.<p>
Some files generated or copied by automake, autoconf and friends are<br>
available in an extra download. These fall under separate licences but are<br>
all free to distribute. Please check their licences as necessary.<p>
