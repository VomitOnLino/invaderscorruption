INVADERS CORRUPTION:
-----------------------
Invaders Corruption is a procedurally generated, freeware areana shooter for Windows, MacOS and Linux written in BlitzBasic and C.

Most of the gameplay and graphics are procedurally generated. It was a project started from an random procedural logo generator project. 

Since I have been repeatedly asked about fixing the compatibility with newer OS Versions such as Windows 10 or the later MacOS versions, I have finally decided to upload the complete source code of the game to GitHub.

It is what you are looking at here.
It includes:
- Sources for  all libraries (some have been modified by me)
- The graphic files and some PSD source files as well as various extras and bits
- The sound files which were created by John Nesky
- The music which has been created by Carlo Castellano


OTHER POINTS OF NOTE:
----------------------
The "data.big" data-file is just a ZIP file with a password (visible within the source-code) and the initial bytes changed to obfuscate the ZIP format.

The web-server is defunct and not part of this release for security reasons. If you want to know more about it you can contact me. The server-side PHP score-validiation algorithm was likely absolutely terrible and should be redone anyway.

I want to express thanks to Carlo Castellano and John Nesky, who contributed to this project for free - as well as all the beta testers, TigSource and anyone else who helped!


CLOSING
-------
If you find anything that does not belong or is not open source or otherwise problematic, please contact me and I shall take it down.

Asking me what a certain bit of code does is likely an exercise in futility since it has been more than a decade. My apologies!

Regardless, here is hoping that Invaders Corruption can live -- again.
